            The DJ App is a fully functional music player that allows
            you and anyone to:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Play</strong>/<strong>Pause</strong>
                    the current song by using the middle 
                    <strong style="color: #cf0000">red</strong>
                    button under the song queue
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Skip</strong> to the next or previous song
                    by using the left and right <strong style="color: #cf0000">red</strong>
                    buttons
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Go to a specific time</strong> in the current song 
                    by using the <strong style="color: #cd00cd">pink</strong> seeker
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Change the current song's speed (BPM)</strong> by 
                    adjusting the <strong style="color: #3f7acf">blue</strong>
                    BPM slider
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Adjust the song queue</strong> by one of the following ways:
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
                            <strong>Sorting the queue by song genre</strong> using the 
                            buttons on the right in the Auto-DJ section.
                        </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
                            <strong>Sorting the queue by song speed (BPM)</strong>
                            using the buttons on the right in the Auto-DJ section.
                        </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
                            <strong>Dragging & dropping</strong> songs directly from and to
                            the queue. This allows the user to be precise and achieve the queue
                            that they want!
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Change the color of the lights</strong>
                    by using the <strong>color wheel</strong> to the right
                    of the BPM slider.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>See the lyrics of the current song</strong>
                    and perform karaoke by clicking the aptly named "Karaoke" button.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <strong>Add voice effects</strong> to your karaoke performance by clicking
                    the "Effects" button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Create a backup</strong> of the current state of the DJ Applet, that 
                    includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The state of the song queue</li>
                        <li>The speed (BPM) of the current song</li>
                        <li>The color of the lights</li>
                        <li>The time of the current song</li>
                        <li>The ratings in the karaoke window</li>
                    </ul>
                    To create a backup, go to the top-left of the window and click the "File". After that, 
                    a dialog box saying "Create Backup" will appear, click and like magic you
                    have created a backup of the DJ!

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Can I add my own songs to the song queue?</strong></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, you cannot. The song queue contains songs 
            from the museums featured artists and due to legal 
            copyright reasons, we cannot allow users to play their own
            songs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Do I have to manually play the next song after the current 
            one finishes playing?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            No, after the current song finishes playing the DJ will 
            auto-play the next one!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Why is the "Effects" button greyed out and why can't I click it?</table></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            For you to be able to click the "Effects" button, <strong>you must have the Karaoke window open!</strong>
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Karaoke</h2>
    <div class="window-help" id="karaoke-help">
        <p>
            The karaoke window provides the user with the lyrics to the current song and also gives everyone else
            in the room the ability to rate the singer's perfomance!.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>If you are the singer</strong>, do not worry about having to change the lyrics
            once the song changes, that happens automatically!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>If you are in the crowd</strong>, you can rate the 
            singer by using the <strong style="color:purple">purple</strong>
            buttons labelled 1 through 5! Be a good sport though, it's hard being
            on stage!
